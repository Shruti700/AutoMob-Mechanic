The website you provided is a project developed using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the use of external libraries. It incorporates several key features:

1. **Login and Signup Functionality:**
   - The website has a secure authentication system with both login and signup functionalities.
   - There are two types of users: normal users and an admin. The admin has access to a different dashboard compared to regular users.

2. **Access Restriction:**
   - Users are not able to access any page other than the home page before they log in. This ensures a level of security and privacy for user-specific content.

3. **Service Exploration and Booking:**
   - Once logged in, users can explore various services offered on the website.
   - Users have the ability to book services, indicating that the website likely has a transactional or booking system in place.

4. **Countdown for Offers:**
   - The website features a unique countdown for offers that lasts for 1 minute and 30 seconds.
   - This countdown begins as soon as the user logs in. After the countdown elapses, no further discounts on services are available. This adds a sense of urgency and exclusivity to the offers.

5. **Data Storage and Expiry:**
   - For testing purposes, all authentication data is stored locally using browser features like local and session storage.
   - Data stored in these locations expires either when the browser is closed or when the user logs out. This approach ensures that user data is not persistently stored on the client side, enhancing security.

6. **Project Deployment:**
   - The project is deployed on Netlify, and the live version can be accessed at [https://silly-gaufre-fd48fe.netlify.app](https://silly-gaufre-fd48fe.netlify.app).

**Specific instructions for testing:You must use 10-digit numbers as passwords for both the admin and regular users.**

In summary, this project showcases a well-implemented web application with authentication, access control, service booking, and time-limited discount features, all developed using fundamental web technologies without relying on external libraries.
